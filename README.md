> A month, not a week and not a quarter. If you can commit ~1–2 hours/day for 30 days, this takes you from "I understand what prompt injection is" to "I've run garak/PyRIT/promptfoo campaigns, built and defended against an indirect-injection exploit, audited an MCP tool-set for the lethal trifecta, scanned a model for supply-chain RCE, and shipped a real capstone."

This sits between the two other repos in the family: faster and more compressed than the [100-day curriculum](https://github.com/ppradyoth/100-days-of-ai-security) (each day here does the work of roughly three 100-day entries), and considerably deeper than the [7-day taste test](https://github.com/ppradyoth/7-days-of-ai-security). Every link is a real, verifiable primary source — a paper, a tool's own repo, or a named CVE. Nothing is padded.

## The 30 Days

<details>
<summary><b>Days 1–6 — Foundations & prompt injection core</b></summary>

- [ ] **Day 1** — Get the mental model: [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) + [Attention Is All You Need, Section 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Note where input validation happens (nowhere — that's the point).
- [ ] **Day 2** — Classical adversarial ML: read [Goodfellow et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572) (FGSM) and build [Lab 1](https://github.com/ppradyoth/ai-security-resources/blob/main/LABS.md#-lab-1-fast-gradient-sign-method-fgsm-on-pytorch) — drop a classifier from >95% to <10% accuracy with an invisible perturbation.
- [ ] **Day 3** — Read the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) in full and write, in your own words, the difference between direct injection, indirect injection, and jailbreaking.
- [ ] **Day 4** — Hands-on: beat [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) to Level 7, documenting which defense layer you defeated each time. Then try [TensorTrust](https://tensortrust.ai/) in both attacker and defender mode.
- [ ] **Day 5** — Read [Zou et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043) (the GCG suffix attack) and [Wei et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02483) (the competing-objectives jailbreak taxonomy).
- [ ] **Day 6** — Read Anthropic's [Many-Shot Jailbreaking](https://www.anthropic.com/research/many-shot-jailbreaking), then run [Lab 2](https://github.com/ppradyoth/ai-security-resources/blob/main/LABS.md#-lab-2-crafting-direct-prompt-injections--jailbreaks): test Base64/roleplay/cognitive-split obfuscation against a local Llama 3.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Days 7–12 — Automated red teaming</b></summary>

- [ ] **Day 7** — Install [garak](https://github.com/NVIDIA/garak), run it against a local model, then write one custom probe.
- [ ] **Day 8** — Install [promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo), run its red-team mode, and wire it into a CI pipeline mapped to OWASP LLM Top 10.
- [ ] **Day 9** — Set up Microsoft's [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT).
- [ ] **Day 10** — Build a PyRIT orchestrator that iteratively rewrites an injection until it breaks a target's system prompt, with an auto-scoring evaluator LLM.
- [ ] **Day 11** — Read [HarmBench](https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench) and [CyberSecEval](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/tree/main/CyberSecEval); run CyberSecEval locally.
- [ ] **Day 12** — Consolidation day: run garak, promptfoo, and PyRIT against the *same* target model and compare which one surfaces which failure classes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Days 13–18 — Agentic exploitation & MCP security</b></summary>

- [ ] **Day 13** — Read [Greshake et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173) (indirect injection, foundational) and build [Lab 3](https://github.com/ppradyoth/ai-security-resources/blob/main/LABS.md#-lab-3-indirect-prompt-injection-via-rag--tool-hijacking): a poisoned RAG document that hijacks a tool call.
- [ ] **Day 14** — Install [AgentDojo](https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo) and read [InjecAgent](https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/InjecAgent); compare their injection taxonomies.
- [ ] **Day 15** — Read [AgentHarm](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm) and [Agent Security Bench (ASB)](https://github.com/agiresearch/ASB) — note ASB's 84.3% attack success rate against current defenses.
- [ ] **Day 16** — Read ["Your AI, My Shell" (Liu et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22040) and [Maloyan & Namiot, 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17548) — agentic coding-assistant injection, empirically measured.
- [ ] **Day 17** — Read the [MCP security best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/security_best_practices) and run [mcp-scan](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan) against a real config.
- [ ] **Day 18** — Read [The Lethal Trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/), audit your own agent's tool-set against it, and study the sandboxing/RBAC material in [`AGENT_SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/ppradyoth/ai-security-resources/blob/main/AGENT_SECURITY.md).

## What you'll have after Day 30

- Real reps with garak, PyRIT, promptfoo, mcp-scan, ModelScan, LLM Guard, and at least one guard model and one observability stack.
- Working exploits (indirect RAG injection, pickle RCE) and working defenses (a guardrail proxy) you built yourself.
- A published capstone that's an actual portfolio artifact.
